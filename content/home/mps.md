Dear residents of Rivervale,

We refer to the new community measures and restrictions announced by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on 14 May, and separately, the discovery of more unlinked cases in the community. In view of this, the Workers' Party MPs have decided to postpone all Meet-the-People sessions until further notice.
